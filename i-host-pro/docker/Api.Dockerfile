# Fase 12, Checkpoint 1 (CI/CD Pipeline Hardening) — packaging validation only.
# Build context MUST be the solution root (i-host-pro/), never this docker/
# folder itself, so project references across Bounded Contexts resolve.

#   docker build -f docker/Api.Dockerfile -t ihostpro-api .
#
# Never pushed to any registry by this checkpoint (CP1 mandate item 18) —
# proves only that a real container image can be produced from the current
# source tree.
